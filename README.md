# safetydump

Rust rewrite of [SafetyDump](https://github.com/m0rv4i/SafetyDump) by [@m0rv4i](https://github.com/m0rv4i/SafetyDump).

The rewrite was written in rust to not rely on the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) and integrate with the [link](https://github.com/postrequest/link/) command and control framework for dumping lsass remotely in memory. Updates and evasion will be contributed in [link](https://github.com/postrequest/link/).
